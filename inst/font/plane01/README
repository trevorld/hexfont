How to modify files in this directory
-------------------------------------

noscript-ranges.txt:
   Update the hexadecimal ranges in the file as new scripts are added.
   Comment lines begin with a ';', so it is convenient to put the name
   of each script in order on a line starting with ';'.

unassigned-ranges.txt:
   For each script, update the hexadecimal code points that are unassigned.
   While noscript-ranges.txt have hexadecimal ranges where no script is
   assigned, unassigned-ranges.txt has hexadecimal ranges that are unassigned
   in a defined Unicode script.

plane01-combining.txt:
   List each hexadecimal code point that is a combining character, one
   code point per line.

plane01-nonprinting.hex:
   Add any new Unicode code points that represent non-printing glyphs.

plane01.hex:
   Add any new printing glyphs.  Do this after modifying all the files
   mentioned above, to simplify the task of detecting duplicates.

DO NOT MODIFY noscript.hex or plane01-unassigned.hex, because they are
generated from the files mentioned above.  Also for the same reason,
do not modify the file all/plane01-all.hex if it happens to exist;
it too is auto-generated from the "make" command.

Typing "make" will:
   - Read unassigned-ranges.txt and generate 6-digit hexadecimal glyphs
     in the file plane01-unassigned.hex for each code point referred to
     in unassigned-ranges.txt.
   - Read noscript-ranges.txt and generate 6-digit hexadecimal glyphs
     in the file noscript.hex.
   - Sort *.hex files, creating the final file all/plane01-all.hex.

Then run

     sort *.hex | unidup

and

     unidup < all/plane01-all.hex

to make sure there are no duplicates.  If there are, remove them.  This
is most likely to happen where a new script is added and those code points
were not removed from noscript-ranges.txt.
