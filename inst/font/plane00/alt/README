     codepage-437.hex         Glyphs for monospaced Code Page 437.

     mongolian-vertical.hex   Vertical Mongolian glyphs.  These
                              were the original form in Unicode
                              and hence in Unifont.  The current
                              Unifont glyphs rotate these glyphs
                              by 90 degrees.

     phags-pa-vertical.hex    Vertical Phags-Pa glyphs.  These
                              were the original form in Unicode
                              and hence in Unifont.  The current
                              Unifont glyphs rotate these glyphs
                              by 90 degrees.

     quad-width.hex           Quadruple width Chinese glyphs,
                              U+9FD8..U+9FE9.  This range covered
                              the ideographs that Russian Orthodox
                              missionaries created to transliterate
                              Church Slavonic into Chinese.  These
                              quadruple-width glyphs  were the
                              original Unifont versions before
                              being replaced by double-width versions.
                              They are the first such quadruple-width
                              glyphs to appear in Unifont, and so
                              could be useful for experimentation.

     reiwa-vertical.hex       Vertical form of Reiwa Era glyph.

     uni0009-orig.hex         Original Unifont Devanagari and
                              Bengali glyphs, which were drawn
                              before Unifont handled combining
                              characters.  The new Devanagari
                              and Bengali glyphs have consonants
                              that are narrower to fit better
                              with combining vowel marks.
