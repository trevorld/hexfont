Note on izmg16-plane02.hex
----------------------------
The file "izmg16-plane02.hex" contains glyphs from the public
domain Izumi BDF font, downloadable at

That BDF font contains glyphs for the JIS X 0213:2004 Japanese
standard, and adds 303 Unicode Plane 2 glyphs to the base Unifont
file to produce the Japanese version, unifont_jp.
