## <a name="overview">Overview</a>

This is an R data package that includes every "hex" font file from the [GNU Unifont](http://unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html) project compressed by `gzip`.  It includes a convenience function that loads several of them as a [{bittermelon}](https://github.com/trevorld/bittermelon) `bm_font()` object.  GNU Unifont is a monoscale bitmap font (8x16 and 16x16 glyphs) that pretty much covers all of the official Unicode glyphs plus several of the artificial scripts in the [(Under-)ConScript Unicode Registry](http://www.kreativekorp.com/ucsur/).

## <a name="hex">Included hex font files</a>

`{hexfont}` includes all the hex font files included in the [GNU Unifont](http://unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html)
source code distribution.  The version number is stripped from the file names in the `precompiled` directory and
the hex fonts are all compressed by gzip but other than that the hex fonts are otherwise unchanged.

```{r included}
hex_dir <- system.file("font", package = "hexfont")
list.files(hex_dir, pattern = ".hex.gz", recursive = TRUE)
```

## <a name="unifont">unifont()</a>

The function `unifont()` loads in several GNU Unifont hex files at the same time as a [{bittermelon}](https://github.com/trevorld/bittermelon) `bm_font()` object.  Arguments:

| Argument | Meaning | Default |
--- | --- | ---
| upper | Include glyphs above the Unicode Basic Multilingual plane | `TRUE` | 
| jp | Use Japanese version of Chinese characters | `FALSE` | 
| csur | Include (Under-)Conscript Unicode Registry glyphs | `TRUE` |
| sample | Add circle to "Combining" characters | `FALSE` | 

```{r unifont, output.class = "bitmap"}
library("bittermelon")
library("hexfont")
# Note Unifont is a **big** font
system.time(font <- unifont())
length(font)
object.size(font)

# Mandarin Chinese
as_bm_list("Ｒ很棒！", font = font) |> bm_call(cbind) |> print()

# Emoji
as_bm_list("🐭🐲🐵", font = font) |> bm_call(cbind) |> print()
```
